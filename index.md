## I would like you to get a few things to me

# A) 
I need to get a materials and purchases list from you.
	Don't worry, this is the fun kind.  
I have a list of really good studio gear I want you to check if any of those kinds of nice things would help or if not what equipment do you want/need?

I'm really being serious about not being stingy on it either. Like really make a good wish list that has no ceiling, no limit to what you could pick up. What are those, a price, and maybe some links to a few.  


# B) 
Though I doubt you need it, I'm sending a notepad I used. If I'm unclear the notes are crystal clear. So that's why.  

B is I need to get a start dozier going from the project. It's a strong point for us I'm thinking anyways. 

What is the film logliner?
> "TVGuide" level blurb with title

What assests are currently in hand?
> Script? What draft? 
> - Has it run through any advanced editing or have other perks?
>    - Do you have a casting board? How fast can we get to making one? Full up with contacts to start outreach when ready?

______________________________________________

### These are just notes and I always put more in than necessary so don't read too far into everything I type out.  

*Here's why,* 

1) I find out what to drop doing. 

2) I skin out the effective methods, be that calanders for those personalities, or drop them quickly for my alpha personalities.
